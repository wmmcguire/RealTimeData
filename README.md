# RealTimeData
• An experimental script for graphing data in real time.
• A sine wave is used as a sample solution with respect to time.
• This script could also be implemented in testing sensors

# Skills Demonstrated
• Graphing with matplotlib
• Display of live data

# What to work on?
• Looking into memory management; live graph slows down after a few seconds.
